# ImageClassification
 Classifies images from the CIFAR-10 dataset. The dataset consists of airplanes, dogs, cats, and other objects - Image recognition, a neural network's predictions on the sample images. 

The dataset consists of airplanes, dogs, cats, and other objects. It preprocess the images, then train a convolutional neural network on all the samples. The images need to be normalized and the labels need to be one-hot encoded. Apply what have been learned on Udacity Deep Net Course and build a convolutional, max pooling, dropout, and fully connected layers. At the end, we see a neural network's predictions on the sample images.
